Hello World,

My name is Mary Jonah, from Ghana. Currently, a web developer with an Bsc in Information Technology with a dream of becoming a Data Scientist.

I created this blog as I have been a beneficiary of posts from other blogs hence in the same measure I also want to give back with what I know. 
I hope you learn while you are here.

Enjoy.
