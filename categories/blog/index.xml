      <description>Hello everyone, after the very long break I am back. It wasn’t intentional: work and personal stuff but I am excited to be back. And as the popular phrase says “I am back with a baaaaang!!”. Image Source
I am excited to announce that I will be starting a series of blog posts from Wednesday, the 1st of August 2018 about Ghanaian elections. First, will show you how to clean them and then analyze election trends since 1992.</description>

      <description>Hello World,
My name is Mary Jonah, from Ghana. Currently, a web developer with an Bsc in Information Technology with a dream of becoming a Data Scientist.
I created this blog as I have been a beneficiary of posts from other blogs hence in the same measure I also want to give back with what I know. I hope you learn while you are here.
Enjoy.</description>
